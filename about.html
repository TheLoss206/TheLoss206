        <h1>About The Loss</h1>

        <p>
            <strong>The Loss</strong> formed in Seattle, Washington in 2010, carving out a sound rooted in
            melodic punk with an edge shaped by urgency, honesty, and community. Active from 2010 to 2016,
            the band built a home and following through relentless shows, DIY ethics, and a commitment to
            writing songs that meant something to the people in the room.
        </p>

        <p>
            During their original run, The Loss released two records on San Diego’s
            <strong>La Escalera Records</strong> —
            <em>Everything You Ever Wanted</em> (2012) and
            <em>Last Rites</em> (2016). Along the way, they were fortunate to share stages with friends and
            peers including Burn Burn Burn, Random Orbits, Success, Poke Da Squid, and many more.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2023 and 2024, The Loss reunited for a series of shows at the place they called home —
            <strong>The Kraken Bar and Lounge</strong> — celebrating the music, the friendships, and the
            years that shaped the band.
